# russomatt.github.io

This is a repository where I store a lot of junk, most of it from back when I was an undergrad. 

If you are here you probably want to checkout [matrix.html](https://github.com/russomatt/russomatt.github.io/blob/master/matrix.html) or [death.html](https://github.com/russomatt/russomatt.github.io/blob/master/death.html)

The live [matrix](http://russomatt.github.io/matrix.html) can be seen here and the live death visualization can be seen [here](http://russomatt.github.io/death.html)
