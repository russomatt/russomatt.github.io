	Since I've been exploring coding "visuals" lately, I decided looking into scripting for Blender would be a worthwile venture. I ended up writing a <a href="https://github.com/russomatt/russomatt.github.io/blob/master/blog-assets/Blob.py">script</a> that created random Metaballs, with changing radiuses and coordinates. Each time these attributes are updated a new keyframe is added, resulting in the animation you see below. I did add the materials, text, and shaders manually though. 
</p>

	Anyway I think it's an interesting method for producing MP4s or gifs for aesthetic or textural elements. Though another use could be scripting to build a 3D model then importing it to the browser using three.js or some other library, then animating it with the afformentioned library. Next time I want to take a step in the 3D direction I plan on looking into three.js or some other 3D web library.
